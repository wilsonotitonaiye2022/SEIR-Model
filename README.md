# SEIR-Model
This is a streamlit app which demostrates the implementation of the SEIR model for modelling epidemiology. The SEIR model is a compartmental model that describes the dynamics of infectious diseases. The model divides the population into four compartments: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), and Recovered (R).
